Jeter had a history of instability. She had been put into a psychiatric care facility after allegedly abusing her eldest daughter in 2004 and attempted suicide in front of her daughters, 12 and 13, in May of 2009 — reportedly in response to her husband having filed for divorce.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>After a brief stint of institutionalization, she was allowed unsupervised visitation with the kids, and a restraining order put in place by her estranged husband was lifted.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>One day later, Jeter arrived to pick up her kids. Telling her daughters that she had a surprise for them, she drove them to a ranch house in Texas’s Hill County, just north of Waco, and took them into the bathroom.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jeter-s-horrific-attack data-injectable=false>Jeter’s horrific attack</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=526 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Per Jeter’s confession, she began her attack by using a knife to slash at her 13-year-old daughter, who yelled to her 12-year-old sister to run. Jeter chased after the 12-year-old and cut her throat, killing her.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News,</a> not long after, she made the 911 call, in which she requested an ambulance for her surviving child. During the call, Jeter refused to identify herself, and scolded the emergency services operator, calling them names and chiding them to “get an ambulance out here to save the one that didn’t die.”</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>She can be heard coldly conversing with her gravely injured daughter, relaying to the 911 operator that she wants them to hurry.</p><p data-characters=236 data-current-count=364 data-injectable=false>Jeter immediately surrendered to the police when they arrived, leaving the murder weapon on top of her car. She was held on a $1.5 million bond. Her surviving daughter was airlifted to the hospital, where she received emergency surgery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jeter-s-plea-bargain data-injectable=false>Jeter’s plea bargain</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>In May of 2010, Jeter, then 33, took a plea bargain, entering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">guilty pleas</a> to all charges against her. This allowed her to avoid the death penalty and prevented her remaining daughter from having to testify against her.</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>After explaining that her actions were driven by her inability to deal with her divorce, she was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Before being transferred to a Gatesville prison where she will spend the rest of her life, she was allowed to see her ex-husband to whom she apologized but also expressed her hatred.</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=105 data-injectable=false>She also saw her daughter, with whom — per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Murderpedia</a> — she shared a few lighthearted moments.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahmK1lmah6tbTEZqqtp6KuerCyjJ2cm6qRYremwMSrZLCgn2K2tHnSoZxmmZ6Zeri0xKucZqGjYsCpsYynprBn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-debra-jeter-who-is-she-and-where-is-she-now.html&text=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Debra%20Jeter%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20where%20is%20she%20now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-debra-jeter-who-is-she-and-where-is-she-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-debra-jeter-who-is-she-and-where-is-she-now.html&title=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Debra%20Jeter%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20where%20is%20she%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-debra-jeter-who-is-she-and-where-is-she-now.html&title=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Debra%20Jeter%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20where%20is%20she%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-debra-jeter-who-is-she-and-where-is-she-now.html&title=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Debra%20Jeter%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20where%20is%20she%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-the-story-of-debra-jeter-who-is-she-and-where-is-she-now.html&description=What%20is%20the%20story%20of%20Debra%20Jeter%3f%20Who%20is%20she%2c%20and%20where%20is%20she%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./matt-champions-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Matt Champion Dating  Matt Champion's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sarah-gadon-husband-max-fine-is-founder-of-pigeon-energy-607833-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sarah Gadon Husband Max Fine Is Founder Of Pigeon Energy">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
