He has been struggling with health for some time now. He passed away after losing his battle with cancer. His son, Andrew Spradlin, announced the sad news of his departure from the world in a <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> </span>on Valley Baptist Church’s social media on Sunday that said,</p><p>“On behalf of our family, it is with a heavy heart that I share with you that my dad, Pastor Roger, passed from this world and entered the presence of Jesus this morning while our church was singing “Goodness of God.” While we had some really great moments this past year, it was also filled with a lot of suffering. But God was merciful and answered our prayers, as Dad has been at such peace and in such comfort over the last several weeks. He passed very peacefully and comfortably with my mom and some of the family by his side. We deeply mourn our loss, but also rejoice knowing that Dad is now in heaven with our wonderful Savior and many loved ones who have gone on before. Our entire family is so thankful for all of your love and prayers! We will be sending out the details of funeral arrangements very soon.”</p><h2>Who was Pastor Roger Spradlin?</h2><p>Pastor Roger Spradlin, also known as Dr. Roger Spradlin, was the founder of Valley Baptist Church in Bakersfield, California. He grew up in Oklahoma, where he maintained a small ranch and visited the place as often as he could. He loved animals and had koi (fish) in a fish pond in his backyard.</p><p>He graduated from Criswell College and attended Oklahoma Baptist University. He also studied at the Southern Baptist Theology Seminar. He had been preaching the Gospel nearly every week since he was 17 years old. He was committed to teaching the Bible through exposition and served his community as a pastor for almost four decades.</p><p>He is survived by his wife, Ginger, and their three children, all of whom are involved in ministry, and grandchildren whom he loved dearly.</p><p>Our sincerest thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends during this difficult time. May he rest in peace.</p><p>Source: <span style=color:red><a style=color:red href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uptospeedjournalism.com</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2S%2FsLPEq2SsqKKWsa21zWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2froger-spradlin.html&text=Pastor%20Roger%20Spradlin%2c%20Founder%20of%20Valley%20Baptist%20Church%2c%20Bakersfield%2c%20CA%2c%20Has%20Died%20at%2068&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2froger-spradlin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2froger-spradlin.html&title=Pastor%20Roger%20Spradlin%2c%20Founder%20of%20Valley%20Baptist%20Church%2c%20Bakersfield%2c%20CA%2c%20Has%20Died%20at%2068" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2froger-spradlin.html&title=Pastor%20Roger%20Spradlin%2c%20Founder%20of%20Valley%20Baptist%20Church%2c%20Bakersfield%2c%20CA%2c%20Has%20Died%20at%2068" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2froger-spradlin.html&title=Pastor%20Roger%20Spradlin%2c%20Founder%20of%20Valley%20Baptist%20Church%2c%20Bakersfield%2c%20CA%2c%20Has%20Died%20at%2068" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2froger-spradlin.html&description=Pastor%20Roger%20Spradlin%2c%20Founder%20of%20Valley%20Baptist%20Church%2c%20Bakersfield%2c%20CA%2c%20Has%20Died%20at%2068" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./interview-with-adrienne-barbeau.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Interview with Adrienne Barbeau | Interviews">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./neopets-nft-project-is-hungrier-for-attention-than-the-neopets-you-havent-fed-for-20-years.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Neopets NFT project is hungrier for attention than the Neopets you havent fed for 20 years">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
