Due to&nbsp;this, for the larger part of her life, Alaina grew up not knowing who her biological <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">father</a> was.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>] <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Dawn Scott </strong>(Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dailymail</a>)</p><p>Her mother suffered from periodic bouts of depression and would resort to drugs more often than not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Dawn's drug addiction would eventually get the better of her. In January 2016, Dawn was found dead in her squalid mobile home in Warren. The cause was an overdose from&nbsp;heroin intake. Alaina was 23 at the time.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>She Was Adopted By Eminem And Raised With His Daughters</h2><p>For better or worse, Alaina was not with her mother during her final days.</p><p>As her mother's&nbsp;drug abuse went from bad to worse, Eminem <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">adopted</a> Alaina in the mid-2000s. He took Alaina under his custody and provided her with a better upbringing. Eminem would play a vital role&nbsp;in keeping her&nbsp;from the influence of her drug-addict mother.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Eminem, whose actual name is Marshall Bruce Mathers III&nbsp;also gave her&nbsp;his name to keep her away from the tragedies of her past.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During her teenage years, Aliana grew up alongside Eminem and his ex-wife Kimberly's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">daughter</a>,&nbsp;Hailie. Alaina also grew up with Whitney Scott Mathers. But unlike, Haile, Whitney is not Eminem's biological daughter;&nbsp;she was born to Kim from another relationship. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><strong>Alaina And Whitney Mathers</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Twins Dawn Scott And&nbsp;Kimberly Scott Ran Away From Home To Escape Abusive Father</h2><p>Eminem's ex-wife Kim and Alaina's mother are actually <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">twins</a>. Dawn's maternal parents were&nbsp;Kathleen Sluck and Casimer Sluck.&nbsp;However, their parents&nbsp;got divorced, and their alcoholic step-father was abusive towards them.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In order to escape abuse from him, Dawn and Kimberly ran away from home in 1988 and settled at a youth shelter outside of Detroit.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong>Kimberly and Dawn Scott pictured in the 90s</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dailymail</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Alaina Also Has A Twin Brother Named Adam</h2><p>Alaina also has two other <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">siblings</a>, Adam and Patrick&nbsp;born to her mother Dawn. And like Dawn and Kim, Alaina and Adam are also twins.&nbsp;Other than the fact that Alain has a twin and one other sibling, not much is known about them.</p><p>The brothers have not let themselves known to the public. And neither Alaina nor Eminem has revealed anything else about them.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eminem Dedicated 'Mockingbird' To Alaina & Hailie</h2><p>Rap king Eminem is famous for his diss songs where he burns his so-called enemies with free-flowing sarcastic lyrics. But he has also dedicated numerous songs to his daughters Hailie and Alaina. Aliana was referenced in Eminem’s <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">song</a>, Mockingbird. He referred to Alaina and Hailie as ‘Lainey’ in the song's lyrics where he says:&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>‘And you and Lainie were too young to understand it ..Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit,’...‘To see how much you both have grown, it’s almost like you’re sisters now...Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy’s still here...Lainie, I’m talking to you too, Daddy’s still here...I like the sound of that, yeah, it’s got a ring to it, don’t it?’</p><h2>Alaina Shies Away from Spotlight But Remains Active On Twitter</h2><p>Alaina Mathers likes to keep away from the spotlight as much as possible judging by the lack of any major social media accounts. However, the one place she can be found is on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While she has been inactive lately, one can see her latest <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> where she can be seen holding up a placard for the protest against the George Floyd shooting.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The fact that we’re still out protesting this shit in 2020 is unreal.
