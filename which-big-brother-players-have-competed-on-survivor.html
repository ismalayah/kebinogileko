And luckily for us fans, we’ve enjoyed crossovers between the two.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=267 data-current-count=267 data-injectable=false>For example, Big Brother 25, which is airing Sunday, Wednesday, and Thursday on the network, is supplying a home to a Survivor legend this summer. Four-time contestant Cirie Fields is the first-ever Survivor contestant to ditch the island for a Big Brother (BB) key.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=545 data-injectable=true>Although this is a Survivor-to-BB first, there have already been two former houseguests who’ve been marooned: Big Brother 12 winner Hayden Moss and Big Brother 16’s Caleb Reynolds. And the latter’s had two opportunities to take home the $1 million grand prize.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>So, let’s get into their respective reality television careers.</p><h2 id=h-hayden-made-it-deep-into-his-survivor-stint-after-taking-home-a-six-figure-check data-injectable=false>Hayden made it deep into his Survivor stint after taking home a six-figure check</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=224 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Hayden made his reality television debut when he entered the Big Brother house in 2010. He was a 24-year-old college student from Tempe, Arizona and after 75 days of play, he earned a life-changing sum of money — $500,000.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=326 data-injectable=false>He was part of one of the most successful alliances in the franchise’s history. Coined “The Brigade,” Hayden partnered up with four other males — Lane Elenburg, Enzo Palumbo, and Matt Hoffman — on the second day of the game. Championed by Enzo, Hayden operated with the moniker “The Animal.”</p><p data-characters=105 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>And his allegiance to the three other men proved to be an early yet pivotal move in Hayden’s game.</p><p data-characters=502 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=true>Operating in the shadows, every name The Brigade said in the Diary Room on eviction night went home. The alliance also survived when Matt was sent to the jury on day 49 to preserve Enzo, his fellow nominee. In the end, Hayden, Lane, and Enzo were the final three houseguests remaining in Big Brother 12. As history has it, Hayden locked in his championship by winning the last Head of Household competition and eliminating Enzo. With a 4-3 vote, The Animal became the US version’s 12th champion.</p><p data-characters=111 data-current-count=111 data-injectable=false>Around three years later, Hayden made history as being the first Big Brother player to cross over to Survivor.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>He was one of 20 contestants during season 27’s Blood vs. Water. It was a unique theme that brought back 10 former Survivor players who were accompanied by a loved one. Blood vs. Water also featured “Redemption Island,” which gave voted-out contestants the opportunity to claw themselves back into the game by winning challenges.</p><p data-characters=166 data-current-count=166 data-injectable=false>In Hayden’s case, he arrived in the Philippines with his girlfriend at the time, Kat Edorsson, who had previously placed seventh on season 24’s One World.</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=662 data-injectable=true>Separated into two tribes of 10, Hayden began his game playing alongside the nine other loved ones as Tadhana. And just like in Big Brother, Hayden found himself on the right side of the votes for the opening part of his game. But, he dealt with his first bit of strategic adversity in episode 4 when Brad Culpepper was sent to Redemption Island. Then, two episodes later, Kat was voted out of her “Galang” tribe — it was the first vote of the game’s post-tribe swap portion.</p><p data-characters=272 data-current-count=272 data-injectable=false>One of Blood vs. Water’s twists allowed a loved one to switch places with their other half. For example, celebrated competitor Rupert Boneham elected to switch spots with his wife, Laura, after she was the first person to have her torch snuffed by host Jeff Probst.</p><p data-characters=370 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>But, Hayden — like everyone else except Rupert — didn’t derail their game for their respective real-life relationship, and Kat officially went home. Hayden then made it to the individual portion of Survivor — the merge. For the first four votes, Hayden sat in the majority, which included the famous moment when Ciera Eastin voted out her mom, Laura Morett.</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=280 data-injectable=false>But, Hayden’s game seriously began to unravel in episode 11 when the season’s dominant alliance — returning players Tyson Apostol, Monica Culpepper, and Gervase Peterson — got the upper hand. Hayden was blinded when his closest ally <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Caleb Bankston</a> was taken out.</p><p data-characters=76 data-current-count=356 data-injectable=false>But, the next episode marked one of the wildest Tribal Councils in history.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=705 data-injectable=true>Ciera, who sided with Tyson and the returnee gang to get out Caleb, jumped back to Hayden and Katie Collins’ side to combat the trio. With only six players remaining, the two groups locked in a tie through two separate votes, which forced a rock draw. Katie ultimately drew the white rock, meaning she was instantly sent to Redemption Island.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>The random draw spelled disaster for Hayden’s game as he and Ciera fell into the minority. And unfortunately for the Big Brother champion, he was the next person sent packing.</p><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>He was unable to capitalize on the Redemption Island twist as well. He lost his first battle-back challenge to Laura M and Tina Wesson, and became the fifth member of the jury. In the end, Hayden tossed Tyson a vote to win season 27, which he did over Monica and Gervase with a 7-1-0 spread.</p><p data-characters=194 data-current-count=194 data-injectable=false>Although Hayden didn’t win Survivor, he was one of the top players of the season and still stands as the closest a Big Brother contestant has gotten to winning the $1 million grand prize.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Known as ‘Beast Mode Cowboy’ on Big Brother, Caleb received a second chance at playing Survivor after he was medically evacuated during his first season</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>The only other Big Brother alum to play Survivor is Caleb, the man known as “Beast Mode Cowboy.” Further, he’s the only houseguest to be a two-time Survivor player. Caleb made his reality competition start on Big Brother 16 as a 26-year-old hunting guide from Hopkinsville, Kentucky.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true>Like Hayden, Caleb was a part of a super alliance early on in his BB run. Caleb joined “The Bomb Squad,” an all-male alliance that fell apart very quickly after skepticism mounted against Devin Shepherd, a driving force behind the group.</p><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>Caleb and Devin sat opposite each other for the third eviction, and the latter was sent packing via a unanimous vote. Although the Bomb Squad was no more, Caleb went through the game believing it was still intact. Specifically, he worked alongside BB16’s winner Derrick Derrick Levasseur and its runner-up, Cody Calafiore, until he was blindsided at the final 4.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=471 data-injectable=true>Caleb’s undying loyalty to the two “Hitmen” was a big part of his eventual undoing.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>But, Beast Mode Cowboy was given two more opportunities to win a CBS show. He appeared on fans’ televisions less than two years later when he played on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season 32’s Kaôh Rōng</a> as part of the “Gondol,” or “Beauty,” tribe.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=416 data-injectable=true>Through BB16, Caleb seemed more geared for Survivor considering his physical abilities. But, his first time marooned didn’t go the way anyone predicted.</p><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=255 data-injectable=false>Not only was he the first person from his tribe to leave the Cambodian island, he didn’t even participate in a Tribal Council. Beast Mode Cowboy was medically evacuated on day 9 after he pushed his body to the limits in a grueling reward challenge.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=409 data-injectable=true>The players competed under the sun for nearly an hour trying to win cooking supplies, and after his tribe placed second, Caleb collapsed onto the ground.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>Continually going in and out of consciousness, the Big Brother alum was tended to by the on-site doctor. He was given oxygen while being monitored. And after the doctor determined Caleb’s heart rate was too low, he was officially removed from the game and sent to the hospital. He made a full recovery.</p><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=625 data-injectable=true>That wasn’t the end of Caleb’s Survivor story. He returned two seasons later for the all-veteran Game Changers iteration. Although it can be argued that Beast Mode Cowboy didn’t fit the bill in terms of the season’s theme, it was great to see him receive another opportunity to properly play.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Still, he didn’t last long. His “Mana” tribe was sent to Tribal Council for the first three votes. And although he voted alongside the majority in the first two Tribals, he once again left the game on day 9.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>Spearheaded by Brad — Hayden’s former alliance member from Blood vs. Water — Caleb was voted out 5-1 in episode 2.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Don’t be surprised if we see more Big Brother contestants crossover to Survivor in the future</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=652 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>With CBS coming out with its own branch of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Challenge</a> — a reality competition staple that’s aired on MTV for decades — it’s clear the network is all in on bringing back past reality stars.</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>The second season of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Challenge: USA</a> is currently dropping two episodes a week on CBS, and it features past players from Survivor, Big Brother, and The Amazing Race, along with veterans from MTV’s flagship show.</p><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=220 data-injectable=false>Some of the Survivor contestants include Edge of Extinction winner Chris Underwood, season 43’s Cassidy Clark, and Ghost Island’s Sebastian Noel. USA 1 featured Tyson — the Blood vs. Water champion — too.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=366 data-injectable=false>On the Big Brother end, season 23’s Alyssa Lopez, season 20’s Tyler Crispen, and season 19’s Josh Martinez are on USA 2 as well.</p><p data-characters=366 data-current-count=732 data-injectable=false>Considering we haven’t seen a familiar face on Survivor since 2020’s Winners at War, it feels like we’re due for returning players, or at the very least, a season with CBS staples. And with Big Brother also embracing Survivor players (Cirie on Big Brother 25), it shouldn’t shock fans if a third houseguest eventually makes their way to Fiji.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMicn2aamZx6o77OrZ%2Beql2luaLFxKuqZqCRq7Jur86mp56slZl6sLqMrKyrrpmrvLN7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhich-big-brother-players-have-competed-on-survivor.html&text=Which%20Big%20Brother%20players%20have%20competed%20on%20Survivor%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhich-big-brother-players-have-competed-on-survivor.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-big-brother-players-have-competed-on-survivor.html&title=Which%20Big%20Brother%20players%20have%20competed%20on%20Survivor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhich-big-brother-players-have-competed-on-survivor.html&title=Which%20Big%20Brother%20players%20have%20competed%20on%20Survivor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhich-big-brother-players-have-competed-on-survivor.html&title=Which%20Big%20Brother%20players%20have%20competed%20on%20Survivor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhich-big-brother-players-have-competed-on-survivor.html&description=Which%20Big%20Brother%20players%20have%20competed%20on%20Survivor%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./2022-world-championships.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="2022 World Championships - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./258957-update-three-bfg-series-matches-set-for-hardcore-justice.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="UPDATE: Three BFG Series Matches Set For Hardcore Justice">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
